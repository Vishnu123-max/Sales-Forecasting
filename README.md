# Sales_Forecasting
Data Mining algorithms are used to generate association rules on online retail dataset for different countries and by applying regression model sales was predicted for a given month. 

The problem statement undertaken for the project is titled as “Sales Forecasting”. The title
suggests that the problem to solve lies in the forecasting of sales. The domain chosen to forecast
these sales is in the retail domain, wherein we have undertaken to forecast the sale for the
month of December 2011 based on the sales data of the previous month. The problem statement
however is not only limited to forecasting of sales but also undertakes the finding of different
patterns in the data using data mining algorithms like Apriori and FP – Growth. Therefore, the
overall problem statement can be summarized as having two parts. The first one being where
the finding of patterns in the data is to be undertaken and the second one being the forecasting
wherein the prediction of sales data for the next month is to be done using the historical data
and techniques of regression.
